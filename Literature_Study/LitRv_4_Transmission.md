##  Can transmission clusters be defined only by SNPs?

In this dataset we did not define a specific SNP threshold. This was mainly because of the size of our dataset (<100 isolates), which left few isolates per transmission cluster to draw a conclusive threshold. Defining SNP thresholds can also be problematic as biological variance (e.g. differing environmental pressures), sampling bias (e.g. missing intermediate isolates) and analytical variance (i.e. SNP calling process) can all introduce large inconsistencies in how the thresholds are defined. Future work in the area of transmission clusters is likely to move away from SNP thresholds and towards probabilistic methods of transmission inference
