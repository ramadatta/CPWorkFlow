# OXA-48
 * blaOXA-48 gene is usually located in pOXA-48a plasmid, which belongs to the group of IncL/M plasmids. This plasmid has high conjugation rate, and it is self-conjugative, explaining partly the global dissemination of OXA-48 enzymes




# Replicon
  * Acquisition of resistant plasmid with multiple replicon types were reported (Huang et al., 2012) that may be attributed to frequent recombination events under antibiotic selection which creates difficulty in typing the resistant plasmids and their mode of dissemination. The random recombination events may also result in re-shuffling of resistant genes under antibiotic pressure during selection of transconjugants. 
  * There are no universal marker sequences that are present across the diversity of plasmids and, due to their recombinogenic nature, there can be conflicting phylogenetic signals between different sections of the same plasmid.
  * The co-integration of replicon types from different incompatibility (Inc) groups is an adaptive mechanism, which plays an important role in plasmid survival and dissemination by extending their host range. Our results highlight the crucial role of IncF alleles (present in 56% of all multireplicons) and revealed that IncH, IncR, and IncU replicons were also frequently carried in multireplicons.
