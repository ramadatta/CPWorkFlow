### Introduction:
* Most prevalent ST clone
* Treatment of antibiotics
* Acquisition of resistance genes through mobile genetic elements
    - specific genomic islands 
    - transposons
    - plasmids
    - integrative and conjugative elements
    - integrons
* Severe infection due to virulence factors
* Toxins of the type III secretion system to circumvent the host immune system and establish infection
* Of the four exotoxins (ExoS, ExoT, ExoU, ExoY), ExoU, a potent phospholipase that disrupts the plasma membrane and leads to rapid cell death, is the most virulent 

#### ST clone

* ST235 one of the high risk clone and poorly understood

#### History of the ST308 clone

* To better understand the history of the P. aeruginosa STXXX lineage as a high-risk international clone, we carried out a Bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction using XXX P. aeruginosa STXXX isolates collected from five continents/countries/hospitals over a XXX-year period.

#### Genomic study of the ST308 clone

* Genome comparison of these isolates identified antibiotic-resistance determinants, virulence genes and ST235-specific genes that may have contributed to the success of this clone.

### Methods

### Results

* **ST308 population structure by phylogenetic network analysis:** 
    - How many clades?
    - largest clade? 
    - Are the isolates between the country/regions/hospital scattered in all clades?
    - Are there any clades specific to a country? 
    - Do the clades have specific geographical origin? 
    - Any clades with all the country/regions/hospital?
    
* **Spatiotemporal origin of the ST308 clone**
    - What is tMRCA of the isolates date to? What is the HPD interval from the date of isolation of the latest isolate in year 2020?
    - When was the oldest isolate isolated and from where country/hospital/continent?
    - When does clade show that the isolate was emerged in the country? Is the split in the year 2005 confirmed with Bayesian approach with a posterior probability score of 1.0. This suggests that in Singapore the spread of ST308 is comprised of atleast two independent clades.
    - Are the SNPs present in the core genome? How much percentage of the SNPs are present in resistant genes and how many in virulent genes?
    - When is the emergence of year of different groups and clades?
