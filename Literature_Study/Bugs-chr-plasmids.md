# Replicon
  * Acquisition of resistant plasmid with multiple replicon types were reported (Huang et al., 2012) that may be attributed to frequent recombination events under antibiotic selection which creates difficulty in typing the resistant plasmids and their mode of dissemination. The random recombination events may also result in re-shuffling of resistant genes under antibiotic pressure during selection of transconjugants.
